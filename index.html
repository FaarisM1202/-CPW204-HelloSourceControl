    <h1>Hello Source Control</h1>

    <p>Learning about git and Github</p>

    <p>Source control works great with VS Code</p>

    <p>I am using basic HTML to upload to Github.</p>

    <p>I like using tools in vs code rather than command prompt because
        there are more features you can use and implement them.
